Keksogram is a photo viewing service. The user can upload their own photos and view photos from other users.

## Statement of work
HTML layout and CSS were originally given.

And my task was to implement the following functions using **JavaScript**:
- upload new photo on the server using **AJAX**
- change the scale of the photo
- applying an effect to a photo
- **validate the form** before sending it to the server (check the existence and length of the comment) (currently implemented using **HTML5**)
- fetching photos and its data using **AJAX** and rendering new **DOM**-nodes with photos thumbnails
